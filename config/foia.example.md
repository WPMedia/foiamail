{DATE}

Dear Officer for Public Records:

This is a records request pursuant to the Washington State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56), which guarantees the public's access to information in the custody of governmental agencies. I respectfully request copies of the following information:

 - Records of blank issued to employees of the {AGENCY} between some date and another date
 - Information being requested includes, but is not limited to: name, date, description, and action(s) taken

I prefer to receive copies of these records via e-mail (my.email@domain.tld) in a machine-readable format (Excel/Word documents, text files, database dump, PDF, etc.).

If these records exist in electronic form, I request that you do not create a new record for me (e.g. by printing your electronic record and then scanning it), but provide the electronic record itself in its native format.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.

Sincerely,

First last<br/>Cell: (999) 999-9999<br/>Email: my.email@domain.tld
